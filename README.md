**PolymorphismMaze**

**Objective**:

The objective of this assignment is to make ourselves more experienced in using OOP con
cepts, especially polymorphism. You should design a maze game, similar to the previous as
signment. In this case, the player patrols a discrete map trying to collect treasures while avoid
ing a roaming guard. I explained the logic and structure in a high-level manner. Now that we 
have finished the course, you should be able to design the details (attributes and methods) by 
yourself. 
Game Rules 
▪ The game world is a 2D discrete grid. 
▪ The maze size should be configurable (e.g. 8×8) 
▪ The player starts at position (0, 0). Position (0, 0) should be located at bottom-left. The 
guard starts at a random position. 
▪ The player and the guard cannot leave the grid. 
▪ Some tiles (random cells) contain walls that block movement. That is, the player and the 
guard cannot move through walls. 
▪ The guard moves randomly within the grid, after the player moves. 
▪ Some tiles (random cells) contain treasures. 
▪ The player wins by collecting all treasures. 
▪ The player loses if he is caught by the guard.
